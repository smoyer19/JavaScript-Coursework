### Pizza Menu
This project is a menu used to order pizza with a various selection of toppings. It then takes the input information and calculates a price for the order.
### Tic-Tac-Toe Game
The classic game of tic-tac-toe. It randomly rolls dice to select which of the two players goes first and then users are off playing the classic game.
### Calculator
A basic 4 function calculator. Users can add, subtract, multiply, and divide on a sleek web version of a calculator.
